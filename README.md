# HI_survey_tools aka Cruisenotebook
Collection of functions and templates to analyse and report IMR fisheries survey data.

Extensively based on https://github.com/jofall/Cruisenotebook for the summary report detailing the survey track, trawl catches, acoustic registrations, CTD data, and other observations during or after a cruise... which make for most of the code so far. Can be set up to read data direcly from the servers on board R/Vs.

Improvement compared to the former version is to keep a generic project that centralise the functions and templates for easier maintenance and update. Templates (more to come, hopefully) can be copied locally and modified to report on a particular survey, with personnal settings and possibly of containing sensitive information (not synced with the repository).
